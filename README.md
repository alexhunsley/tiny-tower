# Tiny Tower

A [web app](https://hunsley.io/tower) for seeing, listening to, and researching change ringing methods.

Ideally it will be useful when playing with new method ideas.

Tiny Tower is BYOPN (Bring Your Own Place Notation) -- it's not a tool for looking up methods. (That said, loading some very common methods will probably be added to the interface in the future.)

It's in beta (early days).

## Why?

There's a load of blueline websites out there already, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

Hardly any of them let you *listen* to a method.

Here's some other things I've found a bit lacking:

* lightness -- almost all existing sites are multi-page affairs, requiring page loads from the server
* selecting/copying text for the row(s) of a method to clipboard
* being able to find rows by using browser's "find in page"
* quality tools: false method detection, music scoring/marking, anti-music detection (e.g. 87s at back, split tenors)

## Ideas

Detect common patterns in a method (including wrap-around) -- to spot music potential.

## Implementation

Tiny Tower is currently written in bare javascript. I may use a lightweight SPA lib at some point (something like Mithril), and possibly Skeleton UI or similar.

## Bugs

Can be filed under [issues](../../issues).

## Where's the code?!

I'm transferring from elsewhere shortly.
